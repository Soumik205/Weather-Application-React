This repository contains a weather application built using React. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and uses the GeoDB Cities API for location suggestions. With an interactive user interface, it allows users to see current weather conditions and forecasts for upcoming times.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather**: The app fetches current weather data using the OpenWeather API, providing users with accurate and up-to-date information.

- **Location Suggestions**: Leveraging the GeoDB Cities API, the application suggests locations as users type, enhancing the user experience.

- **Interactive Interface**: Users can easily switch between various locations, view detailed weather information, and see forecasts for the upcoming hours.


Happy coding!
